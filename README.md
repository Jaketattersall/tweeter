# Tweeter Project
💬 Welcome to Tweeter
Spread your thoughts ~ One tweet at a time! 📢
Tweeter - Twitter clone is a simple, single-page web application that's user-friendly, visually dynamic, and responsive!

Project Definition
Users can create short posts of up to 140 characters and have them append to the main page. Posts are sequential, with the most recent posts appearing at the top of the page. To do so, Tweeter fetches a list of posts from a simplified 'server' and allows users to add posts to this list dynamically. All the requests are asynchronous.

Tweeter Project
This project is made by Jake Tattersall as part of Lighthouse Labs Web Development bootcamp. Tweeter is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX for front-end, and Node and Express, for the back-end.
